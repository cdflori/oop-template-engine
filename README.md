  ## Description 

    This Node CLI application will allow a user to form their employee team by prompt. The user will be able to start the formation of their team by inputting their manager's information. Once manager information has been entered, the user will be prompted to add more employee's to their team. They can select an "Intern" or "Engineer" and add information to that employee. When the user is done building their team, they will select "I'm done building my team." and a team.html file will be rendered. The user can have as many team members as desired. When team.html is rendered the user will see a page similar to below:
